Presenter<br/> CNA<br/>
</p> </div>
    <br/>  <br/>

<p style="margin:10px;">Ms Otelli Edwards has worked in various Mediacorp companies starting as a sports journalist and producing and hosting nightly news shows.

              <br/>
  <h4 style="padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color:#fa0;">Synopsis </h4>
  <p style="margin:10px;">The language environment can have a large impact on the development of a child’s language skills. For children to develop fluency in their Mother Tongue Language, it is vital that they use the language to interact and communicate with others in every environment, be it at home, school or in the community. This early experience in actively using the language plays a critical role in a child’s language development, both socially and psychologically.
</p>
   <p style="margin:10px;">Language learning is a social process. Research has shown that in order to have strong language skills later in life, a person should develop and use their Mother Tongue Language while young and continue through to adulthood. This not only helps them to communicate well with people, but it also helps connect them to their culture and heritage. Frequent and regular adult-child engagement during the early years is associated with better language comprehension, an earlier achievement of language milestones and overall faster growth of language skills.</p>
   <p style="margin:10px;">Come join us for a panel discussion between our Minister for Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing and advocators of Mother Tongue Language learning, including academics, educators, community partner and celebrity parent. They will discuss the importance of providing a language rich environment for young children through talking, singing and reading, and also how to create ample opportunities throughout their day to communicate with others and engage in conversations. The panel will be moderated by Minister of State (Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social and Family Development), Ms Sun Xueling.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color:#fa0;">Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin:10px;">In Singapore today, it is common for young children to grow up in predominantly English-speaking homes. Many parents are concerned that their children will not pick up their Mother Tongue Language before going to primary school.  This presentation will discuss how parents can help their children come to love and enjoy speaking Tamil at home through simple everyday activities and interaction. Parents can provide a rich environment and numerous opportunities for their children to explore and learn Tamil at home. In the early years, when children are beginning to learn the language, the focus is picking up oral skills rather than writing skills. Language is best learnt in a stress-free and safe environment (such as the home) with caring and nurturing adults (such as you, parents).  </p>
