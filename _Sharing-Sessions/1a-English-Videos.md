<h4 style="padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color:#fa0;">Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin:10px;">In Singapore today, it is common for young children to grow up in predominantly English-speaking homes. Many parents are concerned that their children will not pick up their Mother Tongue Language before going to primary school.  This presentation will discuss how parents can help their children come to love and enjoy speaking Tamil at home through simple everyday activities and interaction. Parents can provide a rich environment and numerous opportunities for their children to explore and learn Tamil at home. In the early years, when children are beginning to learn the language, the focus is picking up oral skills rather than writing skills. Language is best learnt in a stress-free and safe environment (such as the home) with caring and nurturing adults (such as you, parents).  </p>
