    <h4 style="font-family:KaiTi;">评语：</h4>
    <p style="font-family:KaiTi; font-size:25px; text-align:justify">
    张纪彭老师的这堂课深入浅出，给评审们留下了深刻的印象。
    <br/><br/>
    为了介绍华族传统文化端午节，她精心挑选教具，通过讲故事，让幼儿了解端午节赛龙舟、吃粽子的来源。在讲故事的同时，带入句型学习，让幼儿一边划龙舟，一边说句子，提高学生的口语表达能力。
    <br/><br/>
    张老师在教学中也带入了裹粽子的活动，让幼儿认识裹粽子的真实材料，通过感官进行学习。她利用幼儿的先备知识，引导他们观察并说出粽叶的形状。张老师也借助幼儿们之前制作香包的经验，让他们举一反三，轻松自信地绑好粽子。<br/><br/>
    在进行延伸活动时，张老师让幼儿发挥创意，通过“我的粽子食谱”，引导幼儿设计和画出自己的粽子食谱，并利用自编“小厨师儿歌”，巩固学习成果。张老师通过简单明了的指示，愉快的学习氛围，让幼儿主动地投入活动，愉快地学习。<br/><br/>
    在日常教学中，张老师十分关注幼儿的需求，以便更好地了解幼儿的兴趣。她创设良好的学习环境，通过各种游戏，让幼儿乐学华语。她每个月还会去图书馆借绘本读给幼儿听，鼓励幼儿阅读华文书籍，丰富华语词汇。<br/><br/>
    张老师不断寻找并尝试激发幼儿学习华文的方法，相信她对教学的热忱和用心，会让许多幼儿对自己的华文学习拥有更多美好的回忆。

   <h4>Judges' Write-up</h4><p>
   Madam Zhang’s lesson impressed the panel greatly.
<br/><br/>
In order to introduce the Chinese tradition of the Dragon Boat Festival, Madam Zhang used various teaching aids such as “story stage” to engage students whilst integrating the teaching of sentence structures into the storyline. As children immersed themselves in role play, they also practised sentence structures and developed their speaking skills.
<br/><br/>
Madam Zhang also designed a lesson on the making of Rice Dumplings (Zong Zi) for children to learn by using all five senses. Tapping on their prior knowledge of leaves and experience of sachet-making, she guided children to observe the shapes of the leaves and followed up with a hands-on session on making Rice Dumplings. 
<br/><br/>
Extending the activity, Madam Zhang developed children’s creativity by having them design their own menu of different kinds of Rice Dumplings following simple instructions. This activity also included an adapted song to further enhance their learning. Unsurprisingly, the happy atmosphere of this lesson encouraged children to learn. 
<br/><br/>
Madam Zhang pays daily attention to each child’s needs and interests as a basis for creating a conducive environment for learning Chinese. She engages her students through games, sources interesting books from the National Libraries to read to her students and encourages them to read as much as possible by themselves to build their vocabulary. 
<br/><br/>
Madam Zhang continues to improve her teaching so as to instil a love for learning Chinese in her children. Her children will grow up with fond memories of her passion for teaching and their early childhood education in the Chinese Language.
