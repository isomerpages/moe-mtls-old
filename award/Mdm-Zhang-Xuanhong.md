   张老师的课由浅入深，有条有理，生动有趣。幼儿能在有意义的学习环境中，建构新知识，实现学习目标。
  <br/><br/>
      课一开始，张老师就通过歌唱和律动，带领幼儿进入森林音乐会的学习情境中。通过图片和提问，张老师加强了幼儿对歌词内容的理解。接着，幼儿戴上头饰，拿着张老师利用环保材料制作的模拟乐器，扮演歌曲中的小动物，进一步加深对内容的理解。
      <br/><br/>
      在张老师的引导下，幼儿利用歌词中出现的小动物和它们所演奏的各种乐器，说出句子。在幼儿掌握了所教导的句型后，张老师开始拓展教学，以此来激发幼儿的想象力，丰富学生的口语表达。她让幼儿用课室里的设备和布置说句子，然后进一步用自己所熟悉的事物来表达，这些事物包括幼儿平时的所见所闻，或自己的先备知识，如家庭成员经常做的事、课堂上最近谈过的话题，或在上学途中看到的事物。
      <br/><br/>
      张老师在教学上循序渐进，帮助幼儿逐步达成学习目标。她对教学充满热忱，她的课生动有趣，引人入胜。在她营造的欢乐、积极的学习氛围中，幼儿都能感受到老师的关爱和重视，并能更有信心地参与活动。

      <h4>Quote:</h4><p>
    Children are curious, active and competent learners. As a Chinese teacher, I believe in creating an environment which children can explore and which encourages them to interact with one another. Learning takes place in activities like songs, raps, interactive games and dramatizations. Such activities encouragechildren to develop a love for learning Chinese -the most effective way toraise their standard of Mandarin.</p>
    <h4>Write up</h4><p>
    Madam Zhang’s lesson was well organisedinto stages of increasing difficulty, whilst at the same time remaining vivid and interesting. The lesson achieved its learning goals byencouraging children to construct new knowledge in a meaningful context.
 <br/><br/>
Atthe start of the lesson, Madam Zhang used singing and rhythmic movements to bring the children into an imaginary world of a concert in a forest. Madam Zhang then used pictures and questioning techniques to deepen her children's understanding of the lyrics. Next, the children put on headgear, held simulated musical instruments made by Madam Zhang (using environmentally friendly materials!) and role-played as animal characters in the songs-an activity that further deepened their understanding of the content.
 <br/><br/>
Guided by Madam Zhang, the children also made use of the characters, musical instruments and song lyrics to construct simple sentences. After the children had grasped the sentence structures taught, Madam Zhang stimulatedchildren’s’ imagination by asking them to use items found in the classroom to construct more complex sentences. This was then taken one step further by encouraging the class to construct sentences using familiaritems and memories from their daily lives. Thisincluded what theywould usually see and hear, their recollection of things their family members often did,topics recently discussed in class, and things they noticed on the way to school.
 <br/><br/>
Madam Zhang’s structured learning procedures enable children to achieve her desired learning outcomes. She uses simple and easy-to-understand class rules to create an enjoyable and positive learning atmosphere for her children. Her enthusiasm for teaching and approachable personality shone throughout these engaging lessons. The children could feel their teacher's care and attention, which gave them the confidence to eagerly participate in all the classroom activities.
