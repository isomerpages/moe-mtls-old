       <p style="margin:10px;"><strong> Multimodal Approaches to Developing Oracy </strong><br/>
        Integrating multimodal experiences, coupled with specific learning objectives and age-appropriate activities, are common pedagogies used in early childhood education. In order to even further recognise and support the diverse abilities and interests of our young learners, plentiful opportunities for lively and authentic expression should be integrated into the child’s environment during the early years. Multimodal approaches in developing oracy such as the use of manipulatives in games, finger puppet activities, paired discussion and storytelling activities, as well as the incorporation of movement into music activities which use verbal communication will be explored in the session.</p>
