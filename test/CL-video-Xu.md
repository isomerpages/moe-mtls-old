  <h4> Synposis</h4>  
   <p>The 2015 Primary Chinese Language Curriculum was implemented at Primary One in 2015 and rolled out to Primary Six this year.  The curriculum aims to enable students to communicate in Chinese, better appreciate Chinese culture and connect with Chinese communities in Asia and beyond.   Our curriculum planners will provide an insight into how the 2015 Curriculum enables young children to learn Chinese in class and how schools support their students in the transition from pre-school to primary school and to provide ideas on how parents can better support their children in learning Chinese in fun and engaging ways.
