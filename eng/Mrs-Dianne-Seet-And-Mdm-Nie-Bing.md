<p style="margin:10px;">Come learn how the team at Ascension Kindergarten taps on various sensorial approaches to develop their childrenâ€™s innate motivation to use and learn about their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children need to experience rather than be taught. How can their sense of cultural identity and connection to Chinese be developed? What can be done to increase their motivation to use their MTL so that they can continually grow to appreciate the language? Come find out more through an interactive session with the team.  </p>
