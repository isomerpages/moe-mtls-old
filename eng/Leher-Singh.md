       <p><h4 style="padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color:#fa0;">Profile</h4></p>
       <p style="margin:10px;">A/P Leher Singh is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the National University of Singapore. She directs the NUS Infant and Child Language Centre. Her research focuses on the impact of bilingualism on language acquisition, social development and cognitive growth in young children. She has published more than 50 research articles on bilingual development and conducts research on how language in bilingual children differs from that of monolingual peers.</p>
  <p><h4 style="padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color:#fa0;">Synopsis</h4></p>  
       <p style="margin:10px;">Raising children bilingually opens them to tremendous opportunities and is crucial to our children’s academic success. At the same time, families often experience challenges in deciding on a pathway to bilingualism and are often confronted with conflicting advice. Many parents also report high levels of stress and anxiety around Mother Tongue Language learning. <br/><br/>
        What does science say about how best to raise a bilingual child? This sharing session will focus on how bilingualism can be expected to impact a child’s development, as well as some of the common challenges that parents face and research-based strategies to support bilingualism in young children.
