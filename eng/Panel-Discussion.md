<h4 style="padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color:#72c6e9;">Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin:10px;">The environment can have a large impact on the development of a child’s language skills. For children to develop fluency in using their Mother Tongue Language, it is vital they use the language to interact and communicate with others in every environment, be it the home, school or community. This early experience in actively using the language plays a critical role in a child’s language development both socially and psychologically.</p>

<p style="margin:10px;">Language learning is a social process. Numerous research studies have shown that the amount and quality of adult-child engagement are two of the strongest enablers for developing language skills in children. Frequent and regular adult-child engagement during the early years is associated with better language comprehension, the earlier achievement of language milestones and overall faster growth of language skills.</p>

<p style="margin:10px;">Come join us for the panel discussion with our Guest-of-Honour, Mr Lawrence Wong; Moderator, Ms Sun Xueling; and advocators of MTL learning including academics, educators, community partner and celebrity parent. They will discuss the importance of early language development and share useful tips on how we can provide an immersive environment in which our children learn and use our MTLs as living languages.</p>
